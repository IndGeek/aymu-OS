# Understanding Stock Prices: How They Move and Who Decides

When you hear about stocks, it can sound complicated. But at the core, it's really about **supply** and **demand** — just like any other market.

Let’s start by understanding what shares actually are before diving into how their prices move.

### **What Are Shares?**

Shares, also called **stocks** or **equity**, represent **ownership** in a company. When you buy a share, you're essentially buying a small piece of that company. The more shares you own, the larger portion of the company you own.

For example:

* If a company has 1,000,000 shares, and you own 10,000 of them, you own **1%** of the company.
* If the company does well, the value of your shares can increase. If the company does poorly, the value of your shares can decrease.

Shares are traded between investors on stock exchanges, like the **New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)** or **NASDAQ** for USA/ **NSE** or **BSE** for India.

### 1. **Total Shares Are Always Fixed**

From day one, the total number of shares in a company is set. These shares are just owned by different people over time.

#### Example:

* **Total shares**: 1,000,000
* **Founders own**: 800,000
* **Public owns**: 200,000

The **200,000 shares** are the ones that are constantly traded.

### 2. **What Happens When All 200,000 Shares Are Sold?**

If **all 200,000 shares** are sold, the next person to buy shares will have to purchase them from **another shareholder**, not from the company itself.

After the company’s IPO (Initial Public Offering):

* The company usually doesn’t get money from trades.
* **Money goes from buyer → seller.**

#### How does it work?

* You buy shares from someone willing to sell.
* If nobody wants to sell, the price goes up until someone does.

Think of it like **Pokémon cards**:

* Only a fixed number of cards exist.
* People trade them.
* The price of the card changes based on how much demand there is.

### 3. **How Demand Affects Stock Price**

Here’s where it gets interesting — stock prices are set by the **order book** on exchanges.

People place:

* **Buy orders** (bids)
* **Sell orders** (asks)

#### Example of an order book:

| Buyers (bids) | Sellers (asks) |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| $10.00        | $10.10         |
| $9.90         | $10.20         |
| $9.80         | $10.30         |

* The **lowest seller price** is $10.10.
* The **highest buyer price** is $10.00.
* A trade happens at **$10.10**.

### 4. **What Happens When Demand Increases?**

When more people want to buy shares, the **bidding price** increases.

Let’s say buyers start offering more money for the shares:

| Buyers (bids) | Sellers (asks) |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| $10.20        | $10.20         |
| $10.10        | $10.30         |

A trade now happens at **$10.20**, which means the stock price has gone up.

It’s not magic. It’s just **people agreeing to pay more** for the stock.

### 5. **Who Decides the Price?**

The simple answer: **The market does.**

Longer answer:

* **Buyers** decide the **maximum** they’re willing to pay.
* **Sellers** decide the **minimum** they’ll accept.
* The exchange simply matches them.

No company, government, or "market maker" decides the stock price in the long term.

---

### 6. **What Makes People Pay More?**

Different factors can make people decide to pay higher prices for shares. Some of them are:

* **Fundamentals**: Profit growth, revenue growth, new products, or competitive advantage.
* **Expectations**: Maybe they think the company will be huge in the next 5 years, or there's hype around specific sectors like AI, electric vehicles, or biotech.
* **Scarcity**: If there aren’t many shares available, or if long-term investors don’t want to sell.
* **Psychology**: Fear of missing out (FOMO), news, social media, and narratives can push people to buy.

---

### 7. **Why Does Price Rise Even if Only One Share Trades?**

Here’s something important: Even if **only one share** is traded, the stock price of **all shares** can rise based on that trade.

#### Example:

* Last trade: 1 share at **$20**
* Now, **all shares are worth $20** on paper, even if the other 199,999 shares didn’t trade.

This is because the **market cap** (company value) updates based on the last traded price.

---

### 8. **Quick Recap**

* After the IPO, shares trade **between investors**.
* More **buyers** willing to pay higher prices push the stock price up.
* No need for new shares to be issued for the price to rise.

It all comes down to **supply and demand**, with buyers and sellers agreeing on prices. Simple, right?

**That’s how stock prices move.** It's all about the competition between buyers and sellers, and who’s willing to pay more for ownership in a company!
